# Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction-with-NLP-models
Every day, social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram generate billions of lines of text. This text is mostly unstructured data, making it difficult and time-consuming to interpret using traditional methods. However, text classification with machine learning can bridge this gap by allowing us to automatically categorize and analyze this data more efficiently. The Kaggle competition, Tweet Sentiment Extraction (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction), offers an insightful opportunity to explore the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The competition entails picking out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment. In this project, instead, I will several NLP techniques to classify tweets into three categories: "positive," "neutral," and "negative," I picked out  a rule-based SentimentIntensity Analyzer as a baseline, the combination of Bag-of-words (tf-idf) and Logistic Regression, the combination of Elmo and Logistic Regression, and BERT.
